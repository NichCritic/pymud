Systems do all the work in the MUD. They can run continuously, or be requested (ContinuousSystem//System)

Systems that run continuously have a queue and their own thread. 
Systems that can be requested run (typically) from the CommandHandlingSystem thread in response to user actions
They basically work the same except the first should have an automatic calling system, where the other can just be called
