Room

Still thinking of this as an object
What would a room system do? Is it really a room system? Or is it a set of other systems?

Traditional room roles:
Container of players and objects
	- Object pointers need to be stored for dynamic descriptions
	- Player pointers can be indirect? Location component
Message passing handler
	- Need a generic message passing system
	- Other uses - object to object communication
Implementation of grid node
	Has a location
		 - Location component (roomid, x, y)
	Has links to other grid nodes
		- Need this? Generating world from pixels. 1 pixel = 100 units square
		- Can go anywhere, unless you can't
		- Good for outdoors, but do we want traditional rooms for indoors?
	
Holds description
	Going to have an object list -> dynamic description generator anyways
